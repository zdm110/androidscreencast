INFORMATION ON UPDATES
**********************

This build has been modified to build as a standalone jar file which is useful
for use on non-network connected devices.
This has been updated to build against newer SDKs with an updated ddmlib interface.
The AndroidScreencastClient build process has been updated to work with ant.
See the README file in the AndroidScreencastClient directory for details on building
the client.
